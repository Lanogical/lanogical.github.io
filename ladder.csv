Right Side CTA Landing Page,"
          Place your call to action form or button on the right side of your landing page to increase activation. Focusing on the right side of your landing page rather than the center, especially when the form remains visible while scrolling down the page, keeps registration forms and CTA buttons above the fold and easily accessible for visitors. This reduces friction between reading your marketing copy and signing up for a demo or free account.

Bucket Brigades,"
          One of the most important aspects of SEO is time on page. The longer people spend on your pages, the more SEO weight those pages will hold. A great way to increase read time in your content is bucket brigades. These are small, short buckets of text (1-2 lines) that make your content easier to read and more scrollable.

Deferred Deep Linking,"
          You can set up a deep link that carries context all the way through the app store download. This lets you create full user journeys that are contextualized for the user in question. So for example, if a user clicks on a web banner and it takes them to the app store, you can still send them to the same content they were viewing on the mobile web after the app downloads.

           For a cleaner, less busy look on your landing page, get rid of copy from images.

Outbound Linking,"

This is known as time to long click. Link out to valuable information sources so users leave your site on your terms rather than through Google, meaning an increase in long clicks and an increase in your search ranking.

By creating a layered lookalike test, we can see where performance drops and expand our audience. i.e. create 1% lookalike, create 2% lookalike (exclude 1%), create 3% lookalike (exclude 1% & 2%).

          Offer an exclusive interview with an industry celebrity as a prize for signing up. The industry celebrity will give credibility to your CTA and potential customers will be more likely to convert due to a fear of missing out (FOMO). The scalability of this tactic is limited, but it can be a great technique for generating your first 100 signups.

Analogy Ad Copy,"
           Using an analogy might be a good way to position your business to people who don't know you. People know ubiquitous businesses like Uber and AirBnB. Tying yourself to a prominent business with an analogy - Uber for X, AirBnB for X, etc… - can help people immediately understand what you do. Rather than being confused by your ad, they’ll get the point instantly and know if it’s right for them.

Example:
“The Rolls Royce of razors”

Since the content already worked so well in the past, it’s likely to perform again, driving up click and open rates on your email.

While time-consuming, this approach is more meaningful and engaging than a like, helps build influencer connections, and encourages social sharing of your content. Use tools like TweetDeck or HootSuite to optimize the process.

This generates very high-quality leads, as you’re getting an email address from people who have already proven themselves willing to commit to engaging with your content.

          Google penalizes sites that have duplicate content - you should remove the duplicate content OR use a rel canonical tag to indicate which one is the original. Removing duplicate content can help your pages properly rank rather than competing against one another. Comb through your site, find places where you have the same exact copy, and make changes and removals where necessary. A site audit tool can help you automate the discovery process for duplicate content.

           Ad creative battle-testing on the Facebook platform (Instagram, Mobile Newsfeed, Audience Network) to find out which combination of image / body copy / call to action is most effective at driving conversion BEFORE spending lots launching many channels at once.       This ensures every piece of paid marketing afterwards is as efficient as it can possibly be, and works as follows:      - Develop x divergent thematic routes for banner (e.g. will people respond better to food imagery vs. block color imagery).   - Develop x divergent thematic routes for articulating the core proposition in the ad headline (e.g. will people respond better to “the perfect recipe” vs. “000s of recipes”?).   - Develop x thematic routes for other test variables (e.g. link  and body copy).   - Identify core target audiences targetable via the Facebook platform.   - Build multivariate test on Facebook advertising platform - each banner variant with each proposition variant on each channel.   - Bid each Ad Group on optimized CPM or optimized CPC - because by doing this Facebook battle-tests Ads within an Ad Group against each other to ID which is most effective for the audience in question. The platform uses all of the data points it has available in order to optimise towards the Ad which gets the most traction with the target audience - which it gives the most reach.   - 30 observations per variant are required for reasonable confidence of significance (e.g. 30 clicks if the goal is a click on oCPC, 30 conversions if the conversion metric is a conversion on oCPM).   The added benefit is that this creates ad sets with conversion data utilisable in later advertising.

          Generating copy that is simultaneously reactive and devaluing of the competition can be tricky. One of the most important things to consider when deploying this tactic is timing. A well-timed ad, citing a current issue or perhaps an athlete during the Olympics, will convert like crazy. Your copy should strive to skew a recent, widely-known reference against the competition. 

Example:
“The Verizon Guy doesn’t like Sprint, he was simply paid a great deal of moola.”
(during Wimbledon) “Roger Federer is being paid to tell you to buy the other guy’s razors”
“Gucci Mane is free, unlike our competitors' express shipping options.”

          Time is one of the most valuable resources universally. And people are constantly searching for ways to better use their time. Highlight the time a person could save by using your product or speak to the fact that they will now have extra time to spend as they choose. Using your product will not only save time, but it will also allow for greater freedom for customers to engage in other activities.

Examples:
“Save 500 hours every year with our management software.”
“Free up your weekends to spend time with the people you LOVE.”
“Save 2 hours a day by switching to our product.”

           Add an email capture box that appears on scroll. Maybe you don’t want to flash an email signup form right in your visitors faces immediately as they view your page. A kinder, gentler option is to have your signup form  exist in a box that shows as you scroll down the page-- this way they’ll see it after they’ve finished reading your post or product page.

Instead of just asking for a user’s email address right away, ask if they’re interested in looking around, then follow that with a prompt to see more content, then follow that with a request for their email.

People consistently prefer completing eight tasks with two done for them over eight tasks with none done for them.

           Once you have a solid lead list, you’ll be able to build an audience for your advertising based on what those leads “look like.” Say you find that a majority of your leads are startups in the New York City area - you’ll be able to build and target an audience of other NYC startups, founders, and their employees. With this approach you'll drive qualified traffic to your site - businesses and individuals similar to ones that have already displayed interest in your product.

           Start with data analysis on what leads to churn on your platform. Once done, automatically tag users ‘at risk’ of churning and target them with increased customer support, incentives, etc... By getting ahead of the problems that a user at risk of churning is experiencing, you’ll be more likely to retain them and alleviate their issues with your service.

Automation Ad Copy,"
          Delivering the message that your offer will automate a laborious task is a definite plus. People want to make their lives easier and anyway you can facilitate this is highly-attractive. Your offer solves their problem with ease. Turn it on and it will do all the work for you. That was easy.

Examples:
“Put your morning shave on autopilot”
“Auto-magically become more productive with our software.”
“Go to sleep and let our laundry system clean your clothes overnight.”

Useful Calculations,"
           Try useful calculations instead of asking to do math. Most people aren't able or willing to do basic calculations, so spelling it out for them can improve conversion. For example telling them how quickly they'll run out of credit, how long ago a post was posted (rather than just a timestamp) and how much they'll save from a discount (rather than a %).

Less Choice,"
           Give a visitor less choice, instead of too many options. Too much choice can limit conversions: The more options you give a potential customer, the harder their decision-making process becomes. Barry Schwartz’s famous Ted Talk on the Paradox of Choice gives a great overview of how too much choice can lead to over-analysis and buyer’s remorse. There is an argument to be made that giving the customer a lot of choice can be freeing for them, but as with all solutions, the best approach is probably to rigorously test each hypothesis.

Rather than directing to your landing page, for example, link to a contextual page based on the ad copy. I.e. webinar ad leads to webinar signup page.

           If you have too much content on a website it might load slow. The solution, to add a 'false bottom' or pagination to the page, solves that problem. However it introduces a new problem - the user is much more likely to bounce rather than click to go to the next page, particularly on mobile. The solution is called 'infinite scroll' - you essentially load more content on the page automatically as soon as  a user hits the bottom of the page. This uninterrupted scroll is popular on many sites now as it has a large positive effect on retention.

           This is an absolute basic SEO tactic, but everyone forgets it consistently. Alt tags for images not only help explain to Googlebot what images are on your site, but can be strong SEO juice in and of themselves. Google will be able to understand what each image is and how to index it. Keep your alt tags relevant to the content on the site and the image itself so that it both explains what’s going on in the image and what the content is that surrounds it.

          Generating copy that is simultaneously reactive and devaluing of the competition can be tricky. One of the most important things to consider when deploying this tactic is timing. A well-timed ad, citing a current issue or perhaps an athlete during the Olympics, will convert like crazy. Your copy should strive to skew a recent, widely-known reference against the competition. 

Example:
“The Verizon Guy doesn’t like Sprint, he was simply paid a great deal of moola.”
(during Wimbledon) “Roger Federer is being paid to tell you to buy the other guy’s razors”
“Gucci Mane is free, unlike our competitors' express shipping options.”

Remove Duplicate Content,"
          Google penalizes sites that have duplicate content - you should remove the duplicate content OR use a rel canonical tag to indicate which one is the original. Removing duplicate content can help your pages properly rank rather than competing against one another. Comb through your site, find places where you have the same exact copy, and make changes and removals where necessary. A site audit tool can help you automate the discovery process for duplicate content.

A user that's seen your video is much more likely to engage with your ad and will be less annoyed with a harder sell. Some platforms like Facebook allow you to target based on how much of the video was watched, so make sure you experiment with that.

Urgency Ad Copy,"
           Using urgency in your ad copy can improve the likelihood of someone clicking and taking action. There are many ways to do this, but make sure it's a credible reason for urgency. For example is your sale ending soon? Is the product only available for a limited time? Is there a limited amount of stock? Are there additional benefits to buying now?

Loss-Aversion Ad Copy,"
          Pointing to a potential loss of not buying your product can be an effective way to drive clicks. Ad copy like “Only X items left!” or “Sale ends in X minutes!” drives a sense of urgency for a customer to avoid losing out on an item they’re interested in or a money-saving opportunity. This is because people are naturally risk averse and would prefer to avoid losing out on an opportunity to get a better deal or miss out on an item they want.

           Google Shopping allows you to show a price and image of the product in your ad. This often dramatically increases performance as people are more likely to click on an ad when they know the price up front. It helps you set expectations for an item’s price immediately rather than allowing the ad viewer to assume your product is too expensive.

           In an age where 25% of internet users only access the internet on mobile and more new web browsing compatible devices are being created every year, it is increasingly important to have a responsive layout that is coded to adapt to all screen sizes.  Responsive layouts load much more quickly than static layouts on smaller screens, which is crucial when, according to Website Magazine, 40 percent of site visitors will leave a page if it takes over 3 seconds to load.  If you’re still not convinced, you should also know that responsive layouts are better for SEO.

           Guiding new users through the onboarding process for your app is a crucial tactic to increase retention and ensure users are effectively using your platform. Creating an onboarding process that has the user run through each part of the app with descriptive and interactive elements ensures that they’re not frustrated by lack of guidance and unclear UX/UI. Further, a guided onboarding tutorial will enable you to learn information about your user that you weren’t able to during registration.

           People are more driven to finish a task as it nears completion. This is known as the Goal Gradient Effect. An example of this working in real-time is a sandwich shop giving away a punch card that offers a free sandwich after your tenth purchase, but with the first two holes punched. People consistently prefer completing eight tasks with two done for them over eight tasks with none done for them.

Pique Curiosity,"
           Rather than putting the whole piece of content behind an email sign-up form, try giving away a preview of some of that content first to pique curiosity. Gating an entire article or whitepaper behind a call to action asks that interested readers take a leap of faith and trust that giving away their email address will be worth it. Providing a section of the content up front instead makes them want more, making the sign-up process a no brainer.

Telling Who It's For,"
          Taking a precision approach to targeting your audience can be very rewarding. Sometimes if you’re targeting everyone, you’re targeting no one. With that in mind, one option is to tell your audience exactly who your product is intended for. This can be a risk/reward play: on one hand, you will immediately disqualify a segment of your potential customers, but on the other hand, you might create a more personal connection with customers who do fall into the categories you’ve targeted.

           Upgrade emails drive users to switch from free to paid accounts, or from lower-tier to higher-tier accounts.  This works via the psychology of loss aversion.

This provides a superior end user experience, as mobile apps are typically faster and better-optimized than mobile websites. It also gives users the full featureset of a dedicated mobile app over the limited features of a responsive mobile site.

          Write about topics that have just been made newsworthy. For example if a political candidate says something about your industry, there will suddenly be lots of people searching for that topic. Inserting yourself into the conversation with timely responses, analysis, and news-worthy content of your own is a great way to get social activity and backlinks for your site.

Endowment Ad Copy,"
          By giving indisputable value to a person you automatically increase the perceived value of your offer. People feel like they are getting a deal (or even a steal) when they are given freebies or trials. And an additional bonus, they will be more likely to continue using your product because people have the tendency to value things more if they already own them. For example, potential customers stand to lose their newly found, useful tool once their free trial ends.

Examples:
“30 day free trial”
“$20 free play for signing up”
“Try it for 14 days.”

          oCPM (optimised Cost Per Mille) bidding at Ad Set level on Facebook allows Facebook to optimiz﻿e the impressions it shows to drive more of the conversions you specify for a fixed budget. This is generally one of the most efficient ways to bid on Facebook, because it allows Facebook to use all of the data points available to the Ads Platform to spend as much money as possible - and Facebook knows you will only continue to spend that money if the results are good.

In order for Ad Sets to improve performance Facebook generally recommend that targetable audience size should be > 1 million and the Ad Set should be driving >25 conversions per day. If the audience size is too small it should be increased to allow Facebook to optimize effectively.

Bidding on your own brand as a keyword is inexpensive and will defend your brand name by making sure your ad shows up #1 when people search for you.

Supplier Brand Keywords,"
           Bidding on the brand keywords for the suppliers of the products you stock usually yields relatively cheap traffic. You do have to be careful as many supplier or affiliate relationships expressly forbid this and either way they may tell you to turn this off. However this tactic works so well that it's common practice amongst aggregation sites.

When used correctly, however, image carousels are a good way to save space, increase user engagement, and consolidate media.  If you think an image carousel could be right for your site, consider these tips from Nielsen Norman Group to maximize your carousel’s effectiveness.

Anticipate Intent,"
           In your UI design, try anticipating the intent of your users to ensure that their experience is smooth and free of frustration. For example, if they’ve opened a hover-over menu, moving their mouse slightly off the menu by accident shouldn’t automatically close it. Instead, anticipate intent by inserting short delays and interactions to keep them happy with your UI.

This can be a risk/reward play: on one hand, you will immediately disqualify a segment of your potential customers, but on the other hand, you might create a more personal connection with customers who do fall into the categories you’ve targeted.

Price Illusions,"
           Breaking prices down to a per-unit price can make the product seem a lot less expensive. By doing so, you help customers judge the value and affordability of your product based on how low the per-unit price rather than on the total cost of the product. This is especially useful in situations where you’re selling monthly subscriptions or larger item bundles. Showing customers how much they can save by increasing their up-front purchase is an effective way to increase conversion.

           Many marketers make the mistake of simply listing facts and the positive attributes of their products. People react much more favorably to products when introduced to them in story form. Tell the journey of where the product came from and why it's relevant to their lives. Add drama and emotion to the features of the product to humanize the transaction. This should have a large impact on conversion.

Email Winner Referral,"
           Emailing a subset of your top users to inform them they’ve won some form of competition can drive referral behavior. Create some sort of competition among your users, such as a rating of the highest level of activity or the most shared content and send out an email letting them know about their success. This can be made into a weekly or monthly email that includes sharing functions and a referral link encouraging top users to invite their friends.

Reaching users on social media based on what they’ve bought off the site can help you better target people who’ve bought products similar or relevant to what you sell. For example, if you’re selling hiking equipment, targeting Facebook and Twitter users who have bought various outdoor sporting goods helps you reach a more relevant audience.

Give users a reason for what they’re doing and an explanation as to what their actions mean.

In order for Ad Sets to improve performance Facebook generally recommend that targetable audience size should be > 1 million and the Ad Set should be driving >25 conversions per day. If the audience size is too small it should be increased to allow Facebook to optimize effectively.

Dormant Retargeting,"
           Retarget users that have fallen dormant. As per 500.co, between 60-75% of subscribers on the average email list are dormant-- they haven’t opened an email from that list in at least six months. An AdRoll survey showed that 90% of marketers said that “retargeted ads are as good or better than the gold standard in digital marketing.” Using paid ads or email to retarget dormant subscribers with a new offer can be exceptionally effective.

A positive review can be the reason a person chooses your offering over the competition. (Tip: use Google Adword review extensions - they can boost clickthrough rate by up to 10%)

Example:
“Rated 5-stars by an independent rating agency.”
“Tech Weekly gave our product a 10/10 rating.”
“The highest rated electric toothbrush on Amazon.”

          Retarget different audiences based on how far they got into your product. If they only saw an item, you can retarget them with image and copy referencing that item. If they got deeper and added an item to the cart, you can target them with the item and a prompt to come back to their cart. If they still haven’t returned, you can give a discount. This can go as deep as a post-purchase follow-up with a related second item.

Fewer Form Fields,"
           When creating sign-up forms, having too many fields can actually decrease sign-up rate. Optimize your forms to only ask for information necessary to the registration process. This decreases the amount of effort and attention a user has to invest into signing up and will result in increased sign-ups and form submissions. Remember that you can also ask for the information in the fields you remove during onboarding or at a later stage in your relationship with that user/client.

           Adding a phone number to a signup page can improve conversion over just asking for email. This works in our experience because people are much more likely to answer their phone vs opening an email, and are again much more likely to convert after talking on the phone vs clicking from an email. This does however tend to decrease the landing page conversion rate to form submission, because people are less likely to give their number. So make sure you track whether the dip in form submission is worth the higher conversion rate to purchase.

           Rather than crowding the elements on your page together, try including more white space or extra padding between elements.  This will make your website much easier to read, resulting in an improved user experience.  Check out Unbounce’s tip for using whitespace as a suggestive cue on a landing page.

           Targeting keywords for an upcoming event can be a great way of driving relevant traffic to your site. Find events in your industry where you know that your target audience will be present and set up ads that target them directly. For example, if you’re selling high fashion for women, in New York City, targeting keywords related to New York Fashion Week is a well-timed way to reach your audience.

           Being more direct in the ad copy can give your users more context before clicking resulting in higher-intent. You can write this way by first writing how you'd normally write it, then aggressively editing to get to a shorter, simpler version. Just say it like it is and boil the product down to its essential components. Your audience will thank you for it.

           Link out to relevant sites to prevent users who come to your site through search from returning to Google. Google considers a search more successful if after clicking on a search result, the user does not return to the search results page to select another link or create a new query.  This is known as time to long click. Link out to valuable information sources so users leave your site on your terms rather than through Google, meaning an increase in long clicks and an increase in your search ranking.

           “Highest quality razor on the market”Comparing the quality of your service against the alternatives can be a good way to position your product. Whether comparing on price, customer service, ease of use, or quality, a favorable comparison against your competition can drive customers to buy from you instead. A great way to do this is to target alternatives to your service based on their negative customer feedback i.e. 'tired of lousy service?'.

You should be careful to test this rigorously and review the leads you get, as we've seen instances of people posting fake job titles, which dents the reliability of this type of targeting. The most accurate job title data we've seen is on LinkedIn.

Landing Page Phone Number,"
           Adding a phone number to a signup page can improve conversion over just asking for email. This works in our experience because people are much more likely to answer their phone vs opening an email, and are again much more likely to convert after talking on the phone vs clicking from an email. This does however tend to decrease the landing page conversion rate to form submission, because people are less likely to give their number. So make sure you track whether the dip in form submission is worth the higher conversion rate to purchase.

Responsive layouts load much more quickly than static layouts on smaller screens, which is crucial when, according to Website Magazine, 40 percent of site visitors will leave a page if it takes over 3 seconds to load.  If you’re still not convinced, you should also know that responsive layouts are better for SEO.

Qualaroo Branching Surveys,"
          You can create surveys with branching paths based on how users respond. If a user says they don't like parts of your product, you can ask them for deeper feedback. You can get clever with branching surveys - a user that shows great interest in your content, for example, can receive an email capture prompt to sign up for a newsletter based on their answers.

Reverse Image Search To Find Link Opportunities,"
          If you produce original imagery for your blog, then chances are someone has reposted your images. A quick Google reverse image search on your images can help you pull up a list of places where your images have been posted. You can then contact them and ask them for a link, which is a lot more valuable for SEO than getting them to take the image down.

Infinite Scroll,"
           If you have too much content on a website it might load slow. The solution, to add a 'false bottom' or pagination to the page, solves that problem. However it introduces a new problem - the user is much more likely to bounce rather than click to go to the next page, particularly on mobile. The solution is called 'infinite scroll' - you essentially load more content on the page automatically as soon as  a user hits the bottom of the page. This uninterrupted scroll is popular on many sites now as it has a large positive effect on retention.

Premium Upsell Email,"
           Upgrade emails drive users to switch from free to paid accounts, or from lower-tier to higher-tier accounts.  This works via the psychology of loss aversion. Basically, people feel a sense of ownership over something they possess, even if it was given to them for free. People are naturally disinclined to give up something they possess, and will pay to keep it-- and so, upselling on a product they already use can be very effective.

Free Content Ad Copy,"
          People love freebies, especially if they are highly-relevant. Create free, branded content that is easy to access and valuable to potential customers. And then, highlight the offer in your copy - linking the potential customer directly to a landing page with the content… not your homepage. This is an effective tactic to capture email addresses. And further down the line, if they are faced with a problem you can solve, they will be more inclined to contact you rather than the competition. 

Example:
“Check out our eBook on the best uses if AI.”
“A must see guide to SEO.”
“Enjoy our free marketing plan template and crush your marketing goals.”

The feedback you get through talking to multiple customers will make an enormous difference to your trajectory, and you'll see a huge retention boost purely because you're showing you care. Make sure you use a block meeting system like Calendly to schedule.

           Optimize your bids/budget based on time of day, week, month, or year. Website sales can go through a great deal of variance over the course of a year. Understanding the specific times at which your conversion rates are highest, and then optimizing your bidding strategy based on that data, can be an efficient way to drive your business. Most major ads and analytics platforms have the ability to report by time of day, week, month and year.

          By giving indisputable value to a person you automatically increase the perceived value of your offer. People feel like they are getting a deal (or even a steal) when they are given freebies or trials. And an additional bonus, they will be more likely to continue using your product because people have the tendency to value things more if they already own them. For example, potential customers stand to lose their newly found, useful tool once their free trial ends.

“$20 free play for signing up”

           Use Facebook’s Multi-Product Ads services when you want to showcase multiple products to a wide audience with many images and lines of copy. Use high-quality images and strong s to best depict your products and grab your audience’s attention. This approach is especially useful when retargeting an audience that has visited your site and browsed items but not made a purchase, displaying a carousel of items similar to what they were looking for in their News Feeds.

Show Don't Tell,"
           Include CTAs, buttons, and links instead of telling people what to do. Create a seamless experience for people to walk through. This works because psychologically we look for clues as to what the default action is. If there is a clear default action the majority of users will take that action without thinking. If you make them think, you risk losing them.

Testimonials Ad Copy,"
          Testimonials are inherently strong drivers of engagement because they come from individuals outside of your company, and therefore, have greater validity.

Examples:
“This product made marketing 10X easier.” - Tim, Tech Venture CEO
“I don’t know what I would do without this.” - Kimberley, Data Scientist
“These guys are worth every penny.” - Steve, Entrepreneur

Founder Calls,"
           Try calling all your customers to ask for feedback. You only need around 15 minutes per call and you can do them via Skype to make it easier. The feedback you get through talking to multiple customers will make an enormous difference to your trajectory, and you'll see a huge retention boost purely because you're showing you care. Make sure you use a block meeting system like Calendly to schedule.

Lead Lookalike Audience,"
           Once you have a solid lead list, you’ll be able to build an audience for your advertising based on what those leads “look like.” Say you find that a majority of your leads are startups in the New York City area - you’ll be able to build and target an audience of other NYC startups, founders, and their employees. With this approach you'll drive qualified traffic to your site - businesses and individuals similar to ones that have already displayed interest in your product.

This makes the registration process more streamlined and makes it a lot less likely that a user will bounce.

(Tip: choose influencers that are highly-relevant to by examining the social profiles of your target audience.)

“A perfume worn daily by @StylishSuzy”
“Endorsed by LinkedIn influencer, Tommy Marketer.”

          Webinars can be a wonderful +1 for paying customers, but they can also be used as a content marketing tool to attract new customers. Webinars offer an intimate experience with potential customers that generates trust and newfound knowledge. Position your webinar around a relevant topic and don’t mention your product until the closing. A rule of thumb is to spend around 45 minutes educating and 10-15 minutes pitching your product. (Hint: to further push the value of your webinar, distill the insights into a blog post to be published afterwards.)

           Keeping focus on a specific area will push more users through the funnel, rather than them getting lost or distracted by other links. Avoid too many distractions in the form of links, large and bold text, and secondary CTAs and instead highlight your primary CTA on your page. Removing these distractions will help visitors focus better on what you actually want them to do - follow your primary CTA to sign up, make a purchase, or register for an account.

Brand Performance ('AIM'),"
           Ad creative battle-testing on the Facebook platform (Instagram, Mobile Newsfeed, Audience Network) to find out which combination of image / body copy / call to action is most effective at driving conversion BEFORE spending lots launching many channels at once.       This ensures every piece of paid marketing afterwards is as efficient as it can possibly be, and works as follows:      - Develop x divergent thematic routes for banner (e.g. will people respond better to food imagery vs. block color imagery).   - Develop x divergent thematic routes for articulating the core proposition in the ad headline (e.g. will people respond better to “the perfect recipe” vs. “000s of recipes”?).   - Develop x thematic routes for other test variables (e.g. link  and body copy).   - Identify core target audiences targetable via the Facebook platform.   - Build multivariate test on Facebook advertising platform - each banner variant with each proposition variant on each channel.   - Bid each Ad Group on optimized CPM or optimized CPC - because by doing this Facebook battle-tests Ads within an Ad Group against each other to ID which is most effective for the audience in question. The platform uses all of the data points it has available in order to optimise towards the Ad which gets the most traction with the target audience - which it gives the most reach.   - 30 observations per variant are required for reasonable confidence of significance (e.g. 30 clicks if the goal is a click on oCPC, 30 conversions if the conversion metric is a conversion on oCPM).   The added benefit is that this creates ad sets with conversion data utilisable in later advertising.

Remove Homepage Sliders,"
          Sliders might seem fun and interesting, but in reality they can negatively affect conversion and bounce rates. This is because they can dramatically lower page loading time, cause “banner blindness” and push your content below the fold. Beyond these three reasons, they also tend to run poorly on mobile devices. Remove homepage sliders to improve your site performance and bring focus to what is most important for you to display.

While supplies last!” With that said, that if used correctly, urgency is a highly effective marketing tactic. Using implied urgency, adding a time-sensitive incentive, or mentioning the quantity of product available are all examples of strategies that can cause a jump in conversion rate.

           Breaking prices down to a per-unit price can make the product seem a lot less expensive. By doing so, you help customers judge the value and affordability of your product based on how low the per-unit price rather than on the total cost of the product. This is especially useful in situations where you’re selling monthly subscriptions or larger item bundles. Showing customers how much they can save by increasing their up-front purchase is an effective way to increase conversion.

And even if you don’t use it, Twitter’s event-targeting calendar provides a heap of event-related stats and data that can give you a better understanding of how the platform's being used to discuss specific celebrations and moments.""http://www.socialmediatoday.com/social-business/how-use-twitter-event-targeting-and-why-you-should
